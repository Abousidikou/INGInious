Installation and deployment
===========================

Supported platforms
-------------------

INGInious is tested under OS X 10.9 and CentOS 7 but will probably run without problems on any
other Linux distribution and even on Microsoft WindowsÂ® (with some adjustments to the
configuration of Boot2Docker).

Dependencies
------------

The backend needs:

- Python_ 2.7+
- RPyC_
- Docker_ 1.6+  (if you use the "local" or "remote" backend)
- Docker-py_    (if you use the "local" or "remote" backend)
- cgroup-utils_ (if you are on Linux and use the "local" backend)

The frontend needs:

- All the backend dependencies
- MongoDB_
- pymongo_
- HTMLTidy_
- PyTidyLib_
- Docutils
- Python's SH_ lib
- Web.py_
- Simple-LDAP_
- PyYAML_

The agents needs (note that the agent is most of time directly launched by the backend, so you won't need to install dependencies manually):

- Python_ 2.7+
- RPyC_
- Docker_ 1.6+
- Docker-py_
- cgroup-utils_

Installation of the dependencies
--------------------------------

Centos 7.0+
```````````

Don't forget to enable EPEL_.

::

	$ sudo yum install git mongodb mongodb-server docker python-pip gcc python-devel libtidy
	$ sudo pip install pymongo pytidylib docker-py sh web.py docutils simpleldap pyyaml rpyc cgroup-utils

Some remarks:

- GCC and python-devel are not needed, but allows pymongo to compile C extensions which result in speed improvements.

- simpleldap is only needed if you use the ldap authentication plugin

- (python-)sh and git are dependencies of the submission_repo plugin

- libtidy and pytidylib are only needed if you use htmltidy to check tasks' output or if you use the edX plugin

.. _EPEL: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL

You can then start the services *mongod* and *docker*.

::

	$ sudo service mongod start
	$ sudo service docker start

To start them on system startup, use these commands:

::

	$ sudo chkconfig mongod on
	$ sudo chkconfig docker on

OS X 10.9+
``````````

We use brew_ to install some packages. Packages are certainly available too via macPorts.
We also use docker-osx_ instead of the official Boot2Docker because it allows to mount
local directory flawlessly.

.. _brew: http://brew.sh/
.. _docker-osx: https://github.com/noplay/docker-osx

::

	$ brew install mongodb
	$ brew install python
	$ sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noplay/docker-osx/1.0.0/docker-osx > /usr/local/bin/docker-osx
	$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-osx
	$ sudo pip install pymongo pytidylib docker-py sh web.py docutils simpleldap pyyaml rpyc

Follow the instruction of brew to enable mongodb.
Each time you have to run INGInious, don't forget to start docker-osx by running

::

	$ docker-osx start


Windows 7+
``````````

Download and install python_, boot2docker_ and mongodb_. Then proceed to the installation of the following Python
plugins :

.. _python: https://www.python.org/
.. _boot2docker: http://boot2docker.io/
.. _mongodb: https://www.mongodb.org/

::

    C:\> pip install pymongo pytidylib docker-py pbs web.py docutils simpleldap pyyaml rpyc

Boot2docker and MongoDB must be running to run INGInious. To run MongoDB as a service, please refer to th appropriate
documentation.

Installation of INGInious
-------------------------

The installation consist on cloning the github repository of INGInious
and to provide configuration option in ``/configuration.yaml``.

::

	$ git clone https://github.com/UCL-INGI/INGInious.git
	$ cd INGInious
	$ cp configuration.example.yaml configuration.yaml

You should now review and tune configuration options in ``configuration.yaml`` according to `Configuring INGInious`_.

Finally, you can start a demo server with the following command.
If you want a robust webserver for production, see :ref:`production`.

::

	$ python app_frontend.py

The server will be running on localhost:8080.


.. _config:

Configuring INGInious
---------------------

Configuring INGInious is done via a file named ``configuration.yaml``.
To get you started, a file named ``configuration.example.yaml`` is provided.
It content is :

::

    tasks_directory: ./tasks
    containers:
        default: ingi/inginious-c-default
        cpp: ingi/inginious-c-cpp
    backend: local
    # .. or ..
    #backend: remote
    #docker_daemons:
    #  - remote_host: "192.168.59.103"
    #    remote_docker_port: 2375
    #    remote_agent_port: 63456
    mongo_opt:
        host: localhost
        database: INGInious
    plugins:
      - plugin_module: frontend.plugins.auth.demo_auth
        users:
            test: test
    allow_html: tidy

The different entries are :


``tasks_directory``
    The path to the directory that contains all the task definitions, grouped by courses.
    (see :ref:`task`)

``containers``
    A dictionary of docker's container names.
    The key will be used in the task definition to identify the container, and the value must be a valid Docker container identifier.
    The some `pre-built containers`_ are available on Docker's hub.

``backend`` and ``docker_daemons``
	``backend`` is the type of backend you want to use. Three backends are available

	- ``local``, that should be used when the frontend is used on the same machine as the Docker daemon. This is the case if you followed this
	  tutorial and use CentOS or any other Linux distribution.

	  In ``local`` mode, INGInious uses the same environment variables as the Docker client to connect to the daemon. It means that if you can use
	  any Docker client command, like ``docker info``, INGInious should run flawlessly.

	- ``remote``, that should be used when the frontend and the Docker daemons are not on the same server. This includes advanced configurations
	  for scalability (see :doc:`../dev_doc/understand_inginious`) and usage on OS X (as the Docker daemon is run in a virtual machine).

	  This settings requires an additional one, ``docker_daemons``. It is simply a list of distant docker daemons. Each docker daemon is defined by
	  three things: its hostname, its port and an additional port used to communicate with the backend. **All these ports should be available from
	  the backend!**. Very specific configuration details are possible; please read carefully the ``configuration.example.yaml`` for more information.

	  The configuration for ``docker_daemons`` shown above is the one for boot2docker.
	- ``remote_manual``, that should never be used directly (it's for debugging purposes).

``mongo_opt``
    Quite self-explanatory. You can change the database name if you want multiple instances of in the improbable case of conflict.

``plugins``
    A list of plugin modules together with configuration options.
    See :ref:`plugins` for detailed information on available plugins, including their configuration.

``allow_html``
    This parameter accepts three options that define if and how HTML values in strings are treated.
    This option applies globally on descriptions, titles and all strings directly displayed.
    By default, all text is supposed to be in reStructuredText format but ``*IsHTML`` options are available in :ref:`course.yaml` and :ref:`task.yaml`.

    ``false``
        HTML is never allowed.

    ``"tidy"``
        HTML will be sanitized by the HTML Tidy library, to ensure that it is well-formed and will not impact the remaining of the document it is included in.

    ``true``
        HTML is always accepted, and never sanitized. (discouraged)

.. _docker-py API: https://github.com/docker/docker-py/blob/master/docs/api.md#client-api


.. _production:

Downloading basic containers
----------------------------

Use this command to pull the default container of INGInious. Lots of other containers are available: `pre-built containers`_.

::

	$ docker pull ingi/inginious-c-default
	$ docker pull ingi/inginious-c-cpp
	
If you pull/create additionnal containers, do not forget to add them in the configuration of INGInious.

.. _lighttpd:

Using lighttpd (on CentOS 7.0)
------------------------------

In production environments, you can use lighttpd in replacement of the built-in Python server.
This guide is made for CentOS 7.0.

First, don't forget to enable EPEL_.

We can then install lighttpd with fastcgi:

::

	$ sudo yum install lighttpd lighttpd-fastcgi

Now put the INGInious' sources somewhere, like */var/www/INGInious*.

First of all, we need to put the lighttpd user in the necessary groups, to allow it to launch new containers and to connect to mongodb:

::

	$ usermod -aG docker lighttpd
	$ usermod -aG mongodb lighttpd

Allow lighttpd to do whatever he wants inside the sources:

::

	$ chown -R lighttpd:lighthttpd /var/www/INGInious

Now we can configure lighttpd. First, the file */etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf*. Modify the document root:

::

	server.document-root = "/var/www/INGInious"

Next, in module.conf, load theses modules:

::

	server.modules = (
		"mod_access",
		"mod_alias"
	)

	include "conf.d/compress.conf"

	include "conf.d/fastcgi.conf"

You can then replace the content of fastcgi.conf with:

::

	server.modules   += ( "mod_fastcgi" )
	server.modules   += ( "mod_rewrite" )

	fastcgi.server = ( "/app_frontend.py" =>
	(( "socket" => "/tmp/fastcgi.socket",
	   "bin-path" => "/var/www/INGInious/app_frontend.py",
	   "max-procs" => 1,
	  "bin-environment" => (
	    "REAL_SCRIPT_NAME" => "",
	    "DOCKER_HOST" => "tcp://192.168.59.103:2375"
	  ),
	  "check-local" => "disable"
	))
	)

	url.rewrite-once = (
	  "^/favicon.ico$" => "/static/favicon.ico",
	  "^/static/(.*)$" => "/static/$1",
	  "^/(.*)$" => "/app_frontend.py/$1",
	)

Please note that the ``DOCKER_HOST`` env variable is only needed if you use the ``backend=local`` option. It should reflect your current
configuration. To know the value to set, start a terminal that has access to the docker daemon (the terminal should be able to run ``docker info``)
, and write ``$ echo $DOCKER_HOST``. If it returns nothing, just drop the line ``"DOCKER_HOST" => "tcp://192.168.59.103:2375"`` from the
configuration of Lighttpd. Else, put the value return by the command in the configuration. It is possible that may need to do the same for the env
variable ``DOCKER_CERT_PATH`` and ``DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY`` too.

Finally, start the server:

::

	$ sudo chkconfig lighttpd on
	$ sudo service lighttpd start

.. _plugins:

Plugins
-------

This section presents a short overview of the main plugins available. All the plugins are located in the folder frontend/plugins, and provide extensive documentation in their "init" method.

Auth plugins
````````````
You need at least one auth plugin activated. For now, two are provided by default: auth.demo_auth and auth.ldap_auth.

demo_auth
!!!!!!!!!

Provides a simple authentification method, mainly for demo purposes, with username/password pairs stored directly in the config file.

Example of configuration:
::
	plugins:
	  - plugin_module: frontend.plugins.auth.demo_auth
    	    users:
                username1: "password1"
                username2: "password2"
                username3: "password3"
                
ldap_auth
!!!!!!!!!

Uses an LDAP server for authenticating users.

Example of configuration:
::
	plugins:
	  - plugin_module: frontend.plugins.auth.ldap_auth
            host: "your.ldap.server.com"
            encryption": "ssl" #can be tls or none 
            base_dn: "ou=People,dc=info,dc=ucl,dc=ac,dc=be"
            request: "uid={}",
            prefix: "",
            name: "INGI Login",
            require_cert: true

Most of the parameters are self-explaining, but:

``request``
	is the request made to the LDAP server to search the user to authentify. "{}" is replaced by the username indicated by the user.
``prefix``
	a prefix that will be added in the internal username used in INGInious. Useful if you have multiple auth methods with usernames used in more than one method.
	
edX plugin
``````````

Provides a *passive* grader for edX XQueue. More information is available on the :doc:`edX <./teacher_doc/edX>` page in this documentation.
Here is an example of configuration:
::
	plugins:
	  - plugin_module: frontend.plugins.edx,
            courseid: "LouvainX",
            page_pattern: "/grader"

``courseid``
	courseid is the id of the course that you want to provide to edX.
	(Please note that you can have multiple instances of the edX plugin, allowing you to use it for more than one course)
``page_pattern``:
	pages that will lead to the edX grader. Can be a simple string or a regex. Note that if you use multiple edX plugin instances,
	page_patterns have to be unique.
