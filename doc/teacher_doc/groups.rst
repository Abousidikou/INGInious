Group work
==========

Students may sometimes be allowed to work in groups. In this case, they are used to submit one common work.
INGInious integrates a group management solution to ease the teacher to correct these grouped works

What is a group ?
-----------------

A group in INGInious is defined as follow: it consists in a possibly changing association of users that make submissions
together, and an identifier/description that enables the easy retrieval of submissions.
That is, every submission is accounted to every student that was member of the group at the submission time,
and the submissions associated to a group are linked to its identifier and may not be made by the same association
of users if the group changed at some time. It is therefore recommended to make only minor changes to a created group.
